## 🐍 What is Python

Python is a programming language.

It allows you to write instructions  
that the computer executes step by step.

Those instructions are:

- explicit
- predictable
- executed in order

## 💡 Why Python exists

Programming is often presented as something complex.

Python was created to make it simpler.

When reading Python code, you should be able to say:
> “I can guess what this does.”

That is not an accident.  
That is the design.

## 🔍 How Python is different from other languages

Many languages require:

- heavy syntax
- many symbols
- strict rules early on

Python focuses on:

- readability 📖
- simplicity ✨
- logic 🧠

You write less.  
You understand more.

## 🌐 Python and Network Engineers

If you work in networking, you already think logically.

You already:

- follow procedures
- apply configurations step by step
- verify outputs
- troubleshoot problems

Programming uses the **same mindset**.

The only difference:

- instead of devices 🌍
- you give instructions to the computer 💻

That’s why Python fits networking so well.

## 🧰 Why Python is useful in networking

With Python, a Network Engineer can:

- automate repetitive tasks ⚡
- validate configurations ✅
- analyze command outputs 📊
- reduce manual errors 🛑

Instead of repeating actions, you automate them.

## 🚀 What matters at the beginning

At the start, only two things matter:

1. Writing code ✍️  
2. Reading output 👀  

Everything else comes later.
