## 🧩 Course 1 — Print & Output

---

## ⚙️ Before you start

Before writing any Python code, make sure Python is installed on your machine.

- Download Python from the official website:  
  https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Run every command yourself  
- Take your time  

Learning Python is not about speed.  
Discipline is more important than understanding everything immediately.

---

## 🎯 What you are about to do

In Lesson 1, you will:

- write your first Python code
- see immediate results
- understand what the computer is doing

You are **not** expected to:

- understand everything
- remember everything
- be perfect

You are expected to:

- try
- run the code
- observe the output

That’s it.

---

## 🧠 Programming is not magic

Programming is often presented as something complex.

In reality, it is very simple:

> you write instructions  
> the computer follows them

The computer does not:

- think
- guess
- understand intentions

It only follows **exact instructions**.

This is good news.

---

## 🖨️ What is `print()`

`print()` is a function.

A function is a reusable block of code  
that performs a specific action.

The role of `print()` is to:
- display information for humans
- show what the program is doing

The computer executes code silently.  
`print()` is how you see what happens.

---

## ▶️ Your first Python instruction

Run this code:

```py
print("Hello, Python")
```

What happens:

- Python reads the instruction
- Python executes it
- Python displays the output

> Instruction → execution → output

---

## 🧰 Built-in functions in Python

Python comes with built-in functions.

They are:

- already created
- already available
- ready to use

Examples:

- `print()`
- `len()`
- `type()`
- `input()`

You did not create `print()`.  
Python provides it by default.

---

## 🛠️ Common uses of `print()`

You use `print()` to:

- display results
- debug code
- confirm actions
- explain what a script is doing
- make automation readable

Automation without output is dangerous.

---

## 🧪 Playing with output

### Printing text
```py
print("Network automation starts here")
```

### Printing numbers
```py
print(42)
```

### Printing multiple values
```py
print("Interface", "eth0", "is", "UP")
```

---

## 🎛️ Controlling the output

### Separator (`sep`)
```py
print("eth0", "eth1", "eth2", sep=" | ")
```

Output:
```
eth0 | eth1 | eth2
```

### Line ending (`end`)
```py
print("Checking interface...", end=" ")
print("DONE")
```

Output:
```
Checking interface... DONE
```

---

## 🌐 Why output matters

In networking, you always:

- run a command
- read the output
- trust the result

Programming works the same way.

Clean output means:

- easier debugging
- safer automation
- scripts others can trust

---

## 🚀 What matters most in this lesson

At the beginning, only two things matter:

- writing code
- reading output

Everything else comes later.

**Clean output is how humans trust automation.**  
**That is why this course starts with `print()`.**

---

## ✅ You are done

If you:

- installed Python
- ran the examples
- observed the output

You completed this lesson.

Go to **Lesson 2 — Variables & Values**  
and continue.
